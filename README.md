The Contact Management System is a simple application that allows users to manage their contact information, allowing them a variety of options to aid in such management. 
In order to use the application, use the simple command of "python contact-management-system.py" then follow the on-screen prompts to manage your contacts. 
The program contains the following menu options:
1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact
4. Search for a contact
5. Display all contacts
6. Export contacts to a text file
7. Quit the application
For each of these options, with the exception of the "Quit" function, the user will be prompted first for an email address. From there the program will prompt the user for the information needed to complete the selected funciton.
The program will continue to ask what the user would like to do until "Quit" is selected, which will exit the program.
